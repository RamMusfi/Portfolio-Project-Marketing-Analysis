# Data Analysis Portfolio Project 3 â€” Marketing Campaign ROI (Power BI)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Interactive Power BI report built to evaluate **marketing campaign performance**, **customer engagement**, and **product spend**.  
Focus: clean modeling inside Power BI (Power Query + Data Model), clear **DAX KPIs**, and business-first visuals.

- **Power BI Desktop** only  
  - Power Query for data cleaning/standardization  
  - Data Model (relationships)  
  - DAX measures for KPIs and ratios  
  - Bookmarks, slicer panel, and drill-through for UX

## ðŸ—‚ Dataset
- Kaggle **Marketing Campaign** (~2.2k rows; one row = one customer).
- Columns include demographics, spend by product, recency, channel interactions, and last campaign response.
- **Assumption for demo KPIs:** constant per-customer placeholders used in the model  
  - `Z_Revenue = 11`
